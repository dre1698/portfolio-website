      <p class="project-description">
        This branding project was created for a local football fanclub based in Bochum. The goal was to design a bold and simple identity that fans could use both digitally and in real life.
      </p>
  
      <p class="project-description">
        <strong>Design Focus:</strong><br>
        The circular logo was used across WhatsApp, shirts, and stickers. It features the silhouette of a fan standing in their usual spot inside the stadium – representing everyone in the group. The club’s home and away colors were used to ensure connection and recognizability.
      </p>
  
      <p class="project-description">
        <strong>Scarf Design:</strong><br>
        A matching scarf was created to capture the energy and unity of matchdays. It includes elements from the logo, strong typography, and a color scheme that fans can wear with pride.
